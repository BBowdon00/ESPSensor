# Custom Libraries

This directory is used for project-specific custom libraries.

PlatformIO will compile all source files (*.c, *.cpp, *.h) in this directory and its subdirectories into the project binary.

## Usage

Place custom libraries here following this structure:

```
lib/
└── YourLibrary/
    ├── YourLibrary.h
    ├── YourLibrary.cpp
    └── library.json (optional)
```
